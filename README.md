This project implements an encoder and decoder for data using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, setup instructions, and more.

## Project Overview

The Huffman Encoder-Decoder project is designed to showcase the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in C++. The project allows users to compress and decompress data using Huffman codes, demonstrating the principles of data compression and decompression techniques.

## Features

- **Compression:** Encode input data using the Huffman coding algorithm to reduce its size.
- **Decompression:** Decode Huffman-encoded data to recover the original data.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.
- **Huffman Tree:** Build a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
- **Code Mapping:** Generate Huffman codes for each character in the input data.

## Usage

1. **Compile:** Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
   ```
   g++ -o huffman main.cpp huffman_encoder_decoder.cpp -std=c++11
   ```

2. **Run:** Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./huffman
   ```

3. **Commands:**
   - `encode <input_file> <output_file>`: Compress the input file using Huffman coding.
   - `decode <input_file> <output_file>`: Decompress the input file using Huffman coding.

## Installation

The Huffman Encoder-Decoder project is written in C++ and doesn't require any external libraries. You can compile and run the project using a C++ compiler like `g++`.

## Algorithm

Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm that assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters. The algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Frequency Analysis:** Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.
2. **Priority Queue:** Create a priority queue (min-heap) of nodes, each containing a character and its frequency.
3. **Build Huffman Tree:** Build a Huffman tree by repeatedly combining the two nodes with the lowest frequencies until a single node is left.
4. **Generate Codes:** Traverse the Huffman tree to generate Huffman codes for each character.
5. **Encoding:** Replace each character with its corresponding Huffman code for compression.
6. **Decoding:** Traverse the Huffman tree using the encoded data to decode it back to the original characters.
